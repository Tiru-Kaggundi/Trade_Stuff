Make a Virtual environment first: 
How to:
- Go to the folder (cluster_app folder in my case)
- Create a new virtual environment using: python3 -m venv venv
- Then activate on Mac: source venv/bin/activate
- If windows, use this to activate: .\venv\Scripts\activate
- Use pip install -r requirements.txt
- after work is done deactivate using deactivate


how to start the server: 
After starting virtual env use this command: 
python app.py
It will give something like: 
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Go to a browser and open this path
ctrl + c will stop this server.
